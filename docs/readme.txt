# Flower Seeker

Flower Seeker is a variation of the Mine Sweeper game. This application was created in Java using Android Studio. Flower Sweeper was created as a partner project for my CMPT 276 Introduction to Software Engineering Class taught by Dr. Brian Fraser. I obtained permission from Dr. Fraser to post this assignment publicly. 

# Contribution:
- I created the welcome screen, main menu screen, game screen, help screen, and options screen. 
- I made the last selected game options persist through each game play. 
- I added animation to the welcome screen
- My partner worked out the game logic and added a congratulation screen to show when user finished the game


Optional Features Implemented for Assignment:
- Welcome screen: animation
- Main menu: nice big flower buttons with a beautiful background
- Game: Play sound on scan and on find a mine
- Game: Save game state if app closed while game playing. Restarting app restarts game where you were.
